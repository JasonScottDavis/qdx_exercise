Dear Quadax Team,

Thanks for agreeing to look at my resume and handing me the coding exercise. I had a lot of fun with it. I do plan on working on it in the future. There's so much more I could have done with OOP principles, specifically encapsulation. As I mentioned in my final commit message on the code, I hope to learn more about you and the Quadax team in the future, and if you're ever looking for something to do, you can always stop by and see what else has been done to NumberMind.

Congratulations on 2022 Best in KLAS!

Respectfully,
Jason
